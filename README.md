# runkit

A better version of the old [lrunkit](https://github.com/daelvn/lrunkit).

## Why?

This one has better support for parameters, even supporting replacement in them such as `$arg`.
It also can silence commands "cross-platform" (probably not.)
It is also less OOP-ey.

## Install

You can install this library via LuaRocks.

```
$ luarocks install runkit
```

## Documentation

Everything can be found at [the homepage](https://git.daelvn.ga/runkit/).
